**The Bee movie is a cinematic masterpiece too far ahead of its time.** *No one could fault you for not understanding its genius.*
Only a true fan, nay, a true genius could properly grasp the full genius that was Barry B. Benson's story arc, how he started his journey and ended it with nearly killing everyone over some honey.
However, my dear reader this is only the beginning, and if you think that this is all the Bee movie has to offer then you are sorely mistaken.
Barry B. Benson and the others in the cast have an intricate story to tell and the entire runtime of the movie does not do justice for the story, nay, this masterpiece's
overall tale.

Now in order to comprehend the humor of this movie alone you must be able to at the bare minimum play 5d chess with universal time travel and only then can you
actually begin to understand the very first joke. However if you wish to grasp the tragic tale of Barry B. Benson then you must go even further, thats right, you must
be able to understand Rick and Morty. This masterpiece has everything one would want from any piece of media, romance, suspense, horror, and even a message on how we
lowely humans must treat the enviornment much better, starting with the glorious bees.
